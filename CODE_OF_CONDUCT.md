# Code of Conduct

Here at LIMP, our guidelines are loose.

**LIMP is about creating a cool programming language, not about enforcing policies.**

However, your co-operation with (and respect towards) other maintainers/users/developers will help keep everything running smoothly and effectively.

---

### Here are a few guidelines you might consider following:

* Try to be respectful, regardless of how wrong something may seem to you.

* If you have a suggestion (e.g. in code review), explain the benefits of your approach.

* If multiple people are deadlocked in a debate about something, tag me (@byxor) and I'll try and help everyone make a decision.

---

Your co-operation with these guidelines is entirely optional. _We're all adults here_.
