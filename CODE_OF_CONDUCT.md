# Code of Conduct

Here at LIMP, our guidelines are loose.

**We're here to create a programming language, not to enforce policies.**

Your co-operation/respect with/towards other maintainers/users/developers will keep everything running smoothly, but that's _your_ responsibility; not mine.

---

### Here are a few guidelines you might consider following:

* Try to be respectful, regardless of how wrong something may seem to you.

* If you have a suggestion (e.g. in code review), explain the benefits of your approach.

* If multiple people are deadlocked in a debate about something, tag me (@byxor) and I'll try and help everyone make a decision.

---

Remember, these guidelines are optional; _we're all adults here_.
